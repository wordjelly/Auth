## sop 1: collect anytime from 8am to 9am
              ## => step 1 :
                ## => depart :
                ## => time : 8 am. -> 9 am
                ## => duration : based on location, and distance of requirement from the location. 
                ## => location is within 50 km of patient coordinates, 
                ## => here there is a need to resolve the duration actually.
                ## => that actually implies resolve requirement.
                ## => which means search for that requirement which satisfies these conditions best, and add it already as being booked for this time slot.
                ## => then later on in the query, we search directly for that requirement id and that time slot.
                ## => so if resolve is true, then the requirement is to be resolved, not the location.
                ## => at certain other stages, it may be necessary to independently resolve location for some reason.
                ## => so that facility should also be provided.
              ## => step 2 :
                ## => arrive 
                ## => time : immediately after
                ## => duration : 1 min
                ## => location : patient location
                ## => here we dont need to do anything.
              ## => step 3:
                ## => collect
