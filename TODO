1.when sign_in fails, typing in the email field, causes credential_check to be performed.
2.Add a loading indicator to the calendar while the images are loading
3.Add a navigation element, like small circles side by side, to indicate when were the last months were the user was active, and this needs to be stored in a correct way, and showed
4.show a message saying that he has or hasnt been active this month.
5.on clicking enter on sign up form, it submits the sign in form.
6.sometimes the sign in modal just doesnt open

10.shift the email_required? to the user_concern
11.the css label in the login form for login => which says "email or mobile" , will have to be customizable from the user side.

14.on selecting autocomplete from drop-down , validation does not occur.
15.shift devise mailer to sidekiq
16.additional param name e.g mobile should be visible in all forms.
17.if they sign up with oauth, how to handle mobile number verification.

20.show counter while waiting for otp to be seeen.


23.the fields do not match thing gets triggered in the sign in form, if after registering a new user, we go back to the sign in form.

24.variabilize the js_erb partials for the whole otp_controller.

27.add recaptcha to update form.

29.user signed in by oauth, goes to forgot password, then what happens?
30.unconfirmed account -> goes to forgot password.
31. email confirmation being sent with mobile sign up.

34. sign out authenticity error

35. resend otp when account already confirmed.

36. after it shows message saying you need to confirm email, it wipes out the email and also does not show pending email. need to work on this. ? maybe call reload?

37. rate limit.

38. abstract otp_controller into a concern

39. sidekiq is down error?

42. permitted params have to be hard coded somewhere in the devise_concern, to allow the app_id and the api_key.


50.what if client id becomes nil.
51.remember to allow in the website only permitted client ids(i.e the one from the app.)



THINGS TO BE DONE:

1. add i18n translations for marathi, hindi.
2. validation for email, is returning cant be blank for additional login param in scenario of signing up for admins with a mobile number instead of an email.
3. on signing up with a mobile, shows "your email is pending confirmation on the edit.html.erb page ->should not show this."
4. otp job, require path is hardcoded at top of file, and also in payment_controller_concern.
4b. add secure compare of the auth token in the authenticate_scope method overriden in devise in registrations controller.
5. receipt
6. payment receipient resolver in case of salaries -> hooked into notifications
7. refund 
8. cash on delivery
9. order acceptance post payment resolver - order status, eta
10. payment acknowledgement in case of any payment 
11. on removing a test from the cart, refund should get triggered, only if it is past the cancellation point.
12. specs
13. what happens to cart items after they are added to a cart? should they still be seen , no, -> that query has to be modified.
14. deep linking + test android
15. email and mobile webhooks and notification retry
16. verify payment test.
17. endpoint to return custom jwt token for firebase sign in
18. image/video upload using firebase cloud storage.
19. create a pathofast app implementing the auth engine
20. geo location api
21. custom user and test creation -> admin ui, and shopping cart for admin
22. write test suite for shopping module
23. after this there will all the stuff to create -> user , collection agent interaction, test updates.
24. 

---> 
while running shopping tests : notify has to be false, investigate why getting some weird error inside the notification lib file.

while running authentication tests : the notify has to be set to true, also there is the issue of the queue adapter, and stub sms otp calls as well as recaptcha and other configuration options.

plan would be as follows:

1. materialize is being used by default -> provide option.
2. oauth routes are drawn whether oauth resources are specified or not.


-->
CARD NUMBER
5123456789012346
CVV:

EXPIRY:

create -> then you go to show -> go to payu -> update -> verify if not verified.



- whats the best way to do this?
- they can be made to choose from a drop down?
- the user for whom they are proxying
- basically a general purpose search box
- search query will go to a search query controller
- from there will be controlled by permissions
- then will fire to elasticsearch for autocomplete
- then will return details
- if user is selected will be another controller action 
called select user
- this can be in profiles controller
- this will add the "proxy" to the session
- this will be used everywhere in token concern.
- it will also display in the layout on the top, which 
- user is being proxied for.


------------

1. create the search response partial
2. for both unauth and normal.
3. inside the erb partials use content_for() so that it can be overridden.
4. also give a button to set the user
5. write a test to see the user is set corretly.
6. write a test to see that user is unset correctly.
7. make all shopping tests pass with the new paths
8. finish views for cart, cart item and product, and payment.

basically today we finish the whole shopping shit.

While creating the sop's

it should show the base sop sequence on the screen.

We can create a flow of SOP
Then we can add alternative sop's at every stage.
and we can go on doing that. 
So we will get a big array of arrays
For each sop, should add id of previous sop.

Now we have to correlate to existing base sop flow.

So let us assume that for step 2 we have four possibilities for hemogram.

and urine is already there with just one possibilty for step 2.

now what happens?

First see if any of them is applicable to any subsequent sop?

If not then where to add them?
We can just add them all one after the other before the next step, creating base sop's out of them wherever possible, and thats it.

So at scheduling, they will have a relative time frame, 

At every stage a next stage can be repeat.
In that case how to arrange it wrt base sop? It's not necessary to create a new base sop , it will be the same base sop. But while scheduling we will have to ignore the repeat ones, 

What if its necessary to repeat everything till then?
- this will invovle - creation of a new plan document -> somehow need to figure out this, and cancelling the existing test from the existing plan document.


But the next question is how to modify on the fly scheduling changes?

For ex in eventuality a -> now do b (so we have to always assume while scheduling the longest sop at each stage.)

So basically while scheduling we need to gather by base sop right.

so we have gathered -> but that doesnt give the correct plan document -> it has to also know which of the base sop groups are to be considered together while deciding what sop duration to consider at each stage.


SOP IDS IN THE TEST DEFINITION.
[a],[b,c,d],[e,f,g],[h,i,j]

BASE SOP SEQUENCE:
a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j

now if we gather by base sop, we will not get the above groups, of sop id.
We need to know for each test, inside its each stage, which SOP to consider and which to ignore while calculating the time taken.

So maybe we land up considering : a,d,e,j

Rest of base sop may be relevant only if some other test has that as its longest sop for a particular stage.

So while scheduling we provision for the longest sop.
And if that one is not needed, or finishes early, then he can jump straight to the next step.



--------------------------

1)create a cart item from product, how to deal with it if an admin wants to create a cart item for himself?

Pass in a proxy resource id, and resource class of the admin, if the user is an admin, and there is no proxy-user at the moment, i.e in the session.


2)view all such cart items without a cart as the wish-list(index cart items)

3)give link to remove them from wishlist - done

4)click "finalize" to add them to a cart.

5)show cart -> to see all the items in it.

6)remove cart items from cart -> by clicking remove.

7)make a cash/card/cheque payment to the cart, only as admin, with a proxy user, cant make a payment without this proxy user

8)make a gateway payment -> get redirected to update the payment as success or failure.

9)on showing payment, update it internally.

10) remove items from cart as admin.

11) make 5 refund requests

12) admin accepts last one.

13) show the status of the refund request, as well as on viewing the refund, auto updates the status.


##
===========================================================

1. add interface for refunds
2. add way to input image concern, for proof for cheque, and card (how would we do card payment?)
3. make sure cash change is seen in the show payment callback.
4. add way to add discount code while creating cart / updating cart. - discount code can only be added if there is pending balance in the cart.
5. check refresh_gateway , if it works.
6. how to do gateway payment with json.

--------------------------------------------------

## send the password to the user, after confirmation.
## show option to resend the sms otp
## show option to resend confirmation email
## admin should be able to directly use the unconfirmed user.


## TODO :

## 1. test json api for :

## a. discounts api
## b. admin create users api
## c. search api
, and fill up the tables for it.
----> two days.

## 4. look for mailbox api 



## 5. write instructions to use in a new app.
---> two days.

from 19 - 24 : put it on amazon.

TODO : 


2)write shopping api json documentation
3)write test for super params allowing.
4)Approval of Refund - how is the money returned - this is by cheque. (here also if the refund is approved, then a photo should be taken, validate in refund approval ? -  they write out the cheque , and then they approve it?) -- add test for refund issue, but this will affect tests, will have to be factored into all the refund tests, or the method will have to be stubbed, even refund approval, expects a photo of the cheque to have been uploaded.
5)Sort out issue about minimum payable amount, and where is it integrated.
8)add tests for owner matches.
9)act on comments in the set_cart_items_accepted.
10)add a test that you cant remove items from a cart if even one payment has been made, whether accepted or not accepted.


THINGS TO FIX IN TOKEN AUTH:

1. store the auth_token as a bcrypted hash - 

-make authentication_token an attr_accessor
-add a field called encrypted_authentication_token
-in ensure authentication token, on setting authentication_token, use Devise::Encryptor.digest to store the digest of the auth_token into the ecrypted auth_token
-in as_json -> return the authentication_token
-see what to do about regenerate_authentication_token - pipe this same function to be used in ensure_authentication_token.
-add the authentication_token in the response headers at the application_controller level.
-in token compare, use the devise method Devise::Encryptor.compare, using the encrypted auth token instead.

2. check if the user lookup is being done by es - mostly being done.
3. then use securecompare to compare the tokens - already done.
4. pass the changed token alongwith every request. - todo
