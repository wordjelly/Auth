21. custom user and test creation -> admin ui, and shopping cart for admin
22. write test suite for shopping module
23. after this there will all the stuff to create -> user , collection agent interaction, test updates.


---> 
while running shopping tests : notify has to be false, investigate why getting some weird error inside the notification lib file.

while running authentication tests : the notify has to be set to true, also there is the issue of the queue adapter, and stub sms otp calls as well as recaptcha and other configuration options.

plan would be as follows:

1. materialize is being used by default -> provide option.
2. oauth routes are drawn whether oauth resources are specified or not.

- whats the best way to do this?
- they can be made to choose from a drop down?
- the user for whom they are proxying
- basically a general purpose search box
- search query will go to a search query controller
- from there will be controlled by permissions
- then will fire to elasticsearch for autocomplete
- then will return details
- if user is selected will be another controller action 
called select user
- this can be in profiles controller
- this will add the "proxy" to the session
- this will be used everywhere in token concern.
- it will also display in the layout on the top, which 
- user is being proxied for.
