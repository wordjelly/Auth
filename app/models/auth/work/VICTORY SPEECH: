The people who played a HUGE part in making this possible:

Dr.Manas Dutta : Studying together with you, showed me there are parts of the mind, levels of endurance, that we don't know we are capable of.

Dr.Priyam Pargaonkar, Dr.Harvinder Singh : You guys put up with all my eccentricities during first year. I don't think I could have found more understanding seniors. Words do not begin to express how much of a difference you people inadvertantly and unknowingly made to my life, especially since you didn't know my story from the preceeding 5 years.

Dr.Shailendra Tiwari : For showing me that all-nighters are possible, this laid the foundation for the 18 hours a day 365 days a year slog that followed.

Dr.Rishabh Joshi : The guy who can answer any medical question under the sun, and I still don't know when you study. I realized that it was possible not to study anything and still know everything. Look after your liver.

Dr.Chaitrangi Rohekar Paranjpe : For your no holds-barred, downright brutal assessment of my life, especially the day you said "Get off your lazy a**, and do something with your life."(Although I was already working on a lot of things at the time). Its rare to find someone who is willing to be so frank. You're like a conscience in human form, and you simply don't give a damn what the hooman thinks. #Awe

Dr.Iqbal Ahmed Farooqui : Your knowledge of competitive exams, and the tips and tricks you shared, were invaluable.

Dr.Monalisa Laturkar : For telling me nearly 6 months ago, that she knew I was going to top this exam. #Psychic

My parents, for the unconditional love, and zero pressure env. They didn't even know I was planning to give this exam, till yesterday.

A special mention to Dr.Karandikar, my original pathology teacher. I still remember the slide you showed us on a rainy afternoon in June 2008, Linitus Plastica. The dedication you show to your work, is impossible to match.

Dr.Kumud Jeswani, for the golden turtle and sugar cubes, these were all i ate on some days.

Furbo the cat: true love is true love, even if you find it in a heartless cat. I still don't know, why I let you go. 

Finally, but as usual the one to whom i owe it all, Dr.Aditya Raut, especially for showing up that night, to make sure that the watchman was asleep '__'
