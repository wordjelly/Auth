Some sunshine after nearly 15 years of hell.

It feels good to be back to doing what I was once the best at.

I'd like to thank some people who have been instrumental in this:

1. My parents - for the unconditional love.

2. My brother - for managing everything at home.
   Dr.Kumud Jeswani - for being so kind all throughout.

3. Dr.Manas Dutta - The only person who saw from up close what it took to get here. It has been a honour and a privilege to know you.

4. Dr.Iqbal Ahmed Farooqi - For all the tips on MCQ's.

5. Dr. Rishabh Joshi, Dr.Shailendra Tiwari - The surgery buddies I should have had from day one, especially Dr.Shailendra who got me into the habit of studying for 24 hours in a row.

Dr.Harvinder Singh, Dr.Vanshika Shahi, Dr.Priyam Pargaonkar, Dr.Jinal Patel, Dr Nidhi Patel, Dr.Khushboo Patel, Dr.Ansul Choudhary, Dr Puja Karalia and all my other colleagues at the Dept of Pathology, who were kind enough to overlook my frequent disappearances. 

Dr.Anjali Kelkar - for teaching us that hematology is much to vast to be learnt in 2 short years.

Dr.Ashka Kodnani - for being so kind while teaching me cytology reporting.

Dr.Nisal, Dr.Doshi, Dr.Jagadale and Dr.Lakhe, Dr.Nimbargi - for everything.

Dr.N.S.Mani for introducing to me the concept of the 1st reading, 2nd reading and 3rd reading. Until then I only read things once.

6. Dr.Manjiri Karandikar my original MBBS pathology teacher, whose dedication to her work is impossible to emulate, and whose concepts are simply too clear to be true.

7. Possibly the most important person: Dr.Chaitrangi Rohekar Paranjpe, who told me to get my act together.

8. Dr.Monalisa Makashir, for telling me 6 months ago, that I was going to top the exam. I don't know how you did that. 

9. Dr.S.P - for existing.
