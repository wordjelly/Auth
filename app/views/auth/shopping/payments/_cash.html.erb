<!-- we want to provide fields for adjusting the amount , in case the patient cannot pay the whole amount. -->
<!-- we want to be able to provide an additional proof url, that shows the signature of the recipient in case this is a salary payment, so how to know if this is a salary payment. -->
<!--- this should depend on the product. -->
<!--- if the product is a salary, then this field should be shown -->
<!--- so we can give a method called, payment_needs_physical_proof, and pass the cart into that.in which case this becomes necessary., the same will also apply to the validation -->
